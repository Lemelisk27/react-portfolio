            <p>I am in the process of obtaining a Web Development Certificate from the University of Washington. My years as a long distance truck driver have given me the ability to work independently, with minimal supervision, while still completing goals and deadlines. When I worked for the IRS, it gave me the ability to work in a diverse environment with people from all walks of life.</p>
